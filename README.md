# HCI Coursework â€“ PULS3122

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains our teamâ€™s submission for the module PUSL 3122 - HCI, Computer Graphics, and Visualisation. The coursework involves developing an interactive software solution following the principles of UI/UX design and computer graphics, in response to a scenario detailed in the module brief.

This project showcases our application of HCI principles using the Agile and Scrum methodologies.

## Development Process

### 1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
- Analysed scenario
- Identified users and context of use
- Developed additional user requirements
- Created user personas and user stories

### 2. Design
- Low-fidelity prototypes & storyboards
- High-fidelity prototypes created using Figma
- UI/UX guided by feedback from initial user evaluations

### 3. Implementation
- Developed the interactive application using React, React Three Fiber, and Three.js
- Incorporated 2D and 3D graphics elements as per the scenario requirements
- Implemented Firebase for authentication and backend services
- Used React Router for navigation and Lucide React for iconography
- Iteratively refined UI based on feedback and user testing

### 4. Evaluation
- Formative and summative testing sessions with two users each
- User testing methods aligned with HCI module teachings
- Incorporated feedback to improve usability and functionality

## User Testing

- **Participants:** [Details â€“ e.g., age range, occupation (anonymous)]
- **Study Setup:** Explained user task flow, obtained informed consent
- **Techniques Used:** [e.g., Think-Aloud Protocol, A/B Testing, etc.]
- **Feedback Integration:** Adjustments made based on user interaction and comments
